# POLYRT2

Finally got around to finishing the first version of this program. This new root finder uses Laguerre's method to converge on both the real and imaginary solutions of the polynomial. However, the error from the calculator's limited persition is still aparent, and the current input is a list of the coefficients. This has the advantage of essentially always converging on a root, regardless of guess (unlike newton's method). Anyways, if the program crashes, just restart with a new guess.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
